In this folder you can place any cli script you want to have executed. It is import that the file ends with ".cli". Otherwise it will not get executed by the read_cli.sh bash script. You can also specify the order in which the cli scripts get executed. Just numerate the cli scripts by placing a number at the start of each script filename (e.g. 01-install_db_driver_module.cli).
